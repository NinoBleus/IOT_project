# IoT Project Guidelines

## Objective
The IoT project aims to showcase students' knowledge and understanding of developing and maintaining an IoT product. The project involves collaboration, demonstrating communication, time-management, and teamwork skills. The key tasks include:

1. Implement a mechanism for automatic software builds on the right platform.
2. Establish a mechanism for automatic software updates on the target platform.
3. Package the software appropriately.
4. Enable the software to push data into a provided database.
5. Implement self-restoration in case of automatic update failure.
6. Visualize data in a dashboard.
7. Securely connect the target platform to the internet.

## Criteria for Success
Evaluation will be based on a presentation and tech demo. Grading criteria include:

- Collaboration and teamwork demonstration.
- Good automation hygiene.
- Strong Git and GitHub hygiene.
- Comprehensive project documentation.
- Excellent developer experience (well-documented README).
- Clear explanation of the IoT aspects of the project.

## Possible Topics for Scoring Points

### Group Dynamics and Documentation
- Group collaboration and teamwork.
- Automation hygiene (minimal manual tasks, extensive automation).
- Git hygiene (commit messages, branching, consistency).
- GitHub hygiene (pull requests, issues, actions).
- Quality project documentation.

### Developer Experience
- Well-structured README for easy onboarding.

### IoT Connectivity
- IoT device securely connected to the internet.
